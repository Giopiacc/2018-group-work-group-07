# The idea

![alt text](https://github.com/drawwithcode/2018-group-work-group-07/blob/master/endangered%20animals.png)

### What is this?
This project is an interactive where the user has to find in the Amazonic jungle five different animals endangered or threatened using a variety of tools: the voice, the keyboard, the mouse... Thought the time they spend playing with it they will discover different characteristics of the animals and interact with the computer.

### Why this idea?
This idea start as a claim about what is happening with the animals because of human. In the last years has increased the number of species in danger or threatened because of human acts and it has been declared as a “global epidemic”. Scientists estimate that up to 200 species die every hour. The deforestation of the Amazon, hunting and other human actions are destroying diverse species. 

With this game the user discover some of the species that are in danger. This is a way to make people awareness about this problem. We have to create conciousness about our "global village".

### Who are we?
This is a project created by Teresa Cremonesi, Andrea Febres Medina, Filippo Ferrari and Cristina Pita da Veiga developed in the course of Creative Coding at Politecnico di Milano.

## Inspirations/References
All the other projects that inspired you, from any perspective (interactive, visual, critical, theorietical, etc)

- Visual

The idea was to create illustrations but not very childish style. At the end the idea is to concern people about a very big problem, the game can be fun with colourfull illustrations, but there is a black screen in the back remember the problem. 

- Interactive projects inspiration

Hidden folks is an inspiration for the project because of the idea of creating a big screen to find the animals.
https://hiddenfolks.com/

Species in pieces is a website where animals in danger are creating with different pieces geometricaly, in this way to can discover more about endangered animals.

This project develoop by propublica give us an idea of what we wanted to talk about: animals in danger of extintion. From this information we achive the idea of the project.

- Theorethical



## --IMAGE/GIF/VIDEO--
A visual recap of your project, it must convey main features and make people want to look at the real sketch

# The project

## Design challenges
Explain choiches behind the design of interactions and the architecture of the sketch. What are the most innovative elements?
If useful, do the same for the visual design of the sketch.

- Design the jungle and the animals


## Code challenges 
challenges On the technical side, what drove you crazy. What are the most interesting and elegant solutions?

- Big screen

At the begginig we started with the idea of creating a big screen to move around. The main problem was if we create this part, we had to cut other parts, so we decided to create a screen with all the elements as Hidden Folks. 

- Light

The light was one of the main lights we wanted to create with the camera, but we found problems to create the reaction with the whole scrren (at the begginig the moving screen gave us a better interaction with light), so we decided to create a different way to use it. With a cover we develop a "light" to wake up the sloth.

- Zoom and size screen

We found the problem that when you zoom with the keyboard or reduze the size of the windows the background can change, so we create a "error" screen to avoid the change of the size.

### Information about the Amazon and the animals
The Amazon is the world's biggest rainforest and is the home of the 10% of species in the planet. Nearly two-thirds of the Amazon rainforest is found in Brazil, but it also cover other countries as Colombia, Peru or Bolivia. The Amazon River is, by far, the world's largest river by volume: 7.000 kilometers.But this incredible rainforest has a very big problem: human action. Unless the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has been declining since 2004, is the biggest front in the world and, as explains WWF, interventions are needed to prevent a large-scale ecological disaster, as WWF explains. Right now, a 20% of the Amazon biome has already been lost.

Blue morpho butterfly  (Morpho menelaus)
 
This butterfly is one of the most known, emblematic and favorite of all Amazon species. They have a characteristic vivid blue color and shiny wings that reflect the light, making them easy to spot amidst the jungle canopy. The blue morpho is one of the largest butterflies in the world, measuring around six inches long and with wing spans of up to 20 centimetres. But there is a problem: they only life 115 days.

Sloth of three fingers (Bradypus variegatus)

The famous animal that always is sleeping is from the Amazon. The sloth of three fingers has short, stubby tails which they use when defecating, and three elongated fingers at the end of each limb. They have also the ability to turn their head through 270° which allows them to save energy while they are scanning for predators. In this way they don’t have to move their whole body. But, (surprise!) they are good swimmers, they have the ability to swim through water three times faster than they can move on the ground.
 
Black spider monkey (Ateles paniscus)
 
This cute monkey feeds on a wide variety of fruits and young leaves, flowers, buds, bark, honey, and occasionally small insects. They are agile primates, capable of moving swiftly through the trees by swinging, climbing, running along branches, or even walking bipedally. Other curious thing is that they can even hang suspended by the tail, leaving both hands free for feeding (they know how to distribute the work). This animal is very social, they live in groups of up to 20 to 30 individuals, divide into smaller or temporary subgroups. The only persistent relationship is between the female and offspring.

Giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus)
 
This curious animal is the largest of one of Earth’s most fascinating groups of armoured animals. The giant armadillo measures up to one meter long, exclusive of tail, with the tail adding another 50 centimetres, be careful, if you trip over him you can hurt yourself. It possesses more teeth than any other mammal (up to 100). Also, they are solitary individuals who feed mainly on termites. They are also good diggers and live in burrows in forests or scrub, emerging at night to feed. Yes, that’s not only vampires staff. 
 
Lemur tree frogs (Agalychnis lemur)

Surely you have seen this animal before, the lemur tree is bright yellowish-green to brown. They can change color depending on whether they are active or resting. For example, when they are active at night, they become more camouflaged as their upper parts turn to brown, also their eyes turn dark gray too. This is going to surprise you: they rarely jump unless fleeing from danger, they move slowly and walk hand over hand. And, this is gorgeous, these amphibians are part of the ‘tree frogs’ families, which have a fossil record in the Palaeocene (65 to 53 million years ago!).
